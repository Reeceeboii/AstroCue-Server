# AstroCue Server

ðŸŽ“ **This repo forms a part of my university dissertation that received a final mark of 91%.**

### Dissertation title: _"AstroCue: planning and logging astronomical observations via computational astronomy, open data, and public APIs"_.

The overwhelmingly large majority of the project's logic and interesting implementation details are housed in this repo, the client was very passive, as is typically the case.

# 1. Project goal (from dissertation document)

_"The main objective of AstroCue was to provide a set of integrated and unified web facilities for the automated planning and subsequent user logging of astronomical observations."_

_"It would consider geographic and celestial coordinates, local time, weather, and light pollution data to provide predicted best viewing times over a short upcoming period, and then allow users to log any
observations that were made."_

# 2. Project architecture

Overall, AstroCue was a distributed client-server system. The server (this repository) is an ASP .NET Core web API (C#), and the [AstroCue Client](https://github.com/Reeceeboii/AstroCue-Client) was a Next.js/React application (TypeScript).

### 2.1 Design patterns

In the broadest sense, AstroCue followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, but with a view noteworthy alterations:

- The **view** layer was actually a separate codebase on a separate domain (see the [AstroCue Client](https://github.com/Reeceeboii/AstroCue-Client)).
- The server, on top of **models** and **controllers**, introduced a **service** layer. This layer housed data access code and a large portion of the business logic. These service classes were specific to a task (i.e. `EmailService` or `UserService`, and had accompanying interfaces such as `IEmailService` and `IUserService`). These service classes were reusable and maintainable as they were fine grained and had their concrete behaviors offered to client classes through their interfaces that were registered with a dependency injection container.

  _This is similar to Martin Fowler's [P of EAA Catalog - Service Layer](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html)._

### 2.3 Class diagram

The server contains many classes across many packages, and during planning, a class diagram was created to aid the structure as the codebase grew. While the actual structure ended up being slightly different than what is depicted here, it adhered enough to still represent the state on a large scale.

## 3. Deployment

The server was deployed to Microsoft Azure. It consisted of an App Service instance, a database (Azure SQL Server), and a blob storage instance. The App Service was where the server executable itself ran, the database was where it persisted all of its data, and the blob storage was somewhat separate, serving as a hosting area for resources (images etc...) delivered via emails to users.

Below is a deployment diagram representing this setup. It also includes the third party APIs and an example of a client.
